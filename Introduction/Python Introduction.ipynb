    "1)Open source: Python is publicly available open source software, any one can use source code that doesn't cost anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Easy-to-learn: Popular (scripting/extension) language, clear and easy syntax, no type declarations, automatic memory management, high-level data types and operations, design to read (more English like syntax) and write (shorter code compared to C, C++, and Java) fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)High-level Language:\n",
    "High-level language (closer to human) refers to the higher level of concept from machine language (for example assembly languages). Python is an example of a high-level language like C, C++, Perl, and Java with low-level optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Portable:\n",
    "High level languages are portable, which means they are able to run across all major hardware and software platforms with few or no change in source code. Python is portable and can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris, FreeBSD, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400 and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Object-Oriented: Python is a full-featured object-oriented programming language, with features such as classes, inheritance, objects, and overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Python is Interactive :\n",
    "Python has an interactive console where you get a Python prompt (command line) and interact with the interpreter directly to write and test your programs. This is useful for mathematical programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Interpreted : Python programs are interpreted, takes source code as input, and then compiles (to portable byte-code) each statement and executes it immediately. No need to compiling or linking\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Extendable : Python is often referred to as a \"glue\" language, meaning that it is capable to work in mixed-language environment. The Python interpreter is easily extended and can add a new built-in function or modules written in C/C++/Java code.\n",
    "\n",
    "9)Libraries : Databases, web services, networking, numerical packages, graphical user interfaces, 3D graphics, others.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)Supports :Support from online Python community\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Embeddable:\n",
    "The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Dynamic Memory Allocation:\n",
    "In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15."

    "1) Python 2 uses print as a statement and used as print \"something\" to print some string on the         console. On the other hand, Python 3 uses print as a function and used as print(\"something\") to       print something on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string     representing the value, which is typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 uses input() function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user. However, we can cast this value to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range() returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) There is also a small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. It defines a keyword as which is necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling section of Python programming tutorial."
